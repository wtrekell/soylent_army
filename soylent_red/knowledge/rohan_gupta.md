## 4. Narrative Elements
This section contains the qualitative data that brings the persona to life, including their story, challenges, and measures of success.
* **Biography**  
  * Rohan built his reputation redesigning government services before joining finance. He survived the 2008 crash as a junior designer, watched the 2020 remote revolution reshape design, and now faces the AI transformation. His teenager asks why he still sketches on paper; his reports ask why he's not moving faster with AI. He navigates both with the same measured approach.  
* **Pain Points (Ranked by Impact)**  
  1. **Accountability Maze**: If an AI hallucinates financial advice in a prototype, who's liable? The designer? The AI vendor? Rohan's signature is on everything, and he fears a junior might paste sensitive PII into a public tool.  
  2. **Executive Impatience**: The CEO wants an "AI transformation" by Q3, while Compliance wants a two-year review cycle. Rohan is stuck managing impossible expectations daily.  
  3. **Team Fragmentation**: Senior designers resist AI ("kills craft"), juniors overuse it ("the future"), and mid-levels are confused, leading to no unified approach.  
  4. **Measurement Void**: How do you quantify "responsible AI use"? Current KPIs reward speed, not judgment.  
* **Budget & Purchasing Authority**  
  * Personal/Team Tool Budget: $10,000+/month  
  * Training/Course Budget: $25,000-50,000/year  
  * Conference Budget: Premium events + speaker  
* **Success Indicators**  
  * Organizational adoption: 80% within a year  
  * Compliance metrics: 100% adherence required  
  * ROI documentation: 15%+ efficiency gains  
  * Industry recognition: Speaker invitations  
* **Key Quote**  
  * "I've been through enough 'transformations' to know: the tech that sticks is the tech that considers humans first. My job isn't to be the AI champion or the AI skeptic—it's to be the adult in the room asking 'then what happens?'"  
* **Scenario**  
  * Thursday morning, Rohan presents AI adoption metrics to the Executive Leadership Team. The CEO interrupts: "Why only three teams? JPMorgan has AI across all design. We're falling behind." Back at his desk, he faces the daily Slack onslaught from Legal, concerned designers, and panicked juniors. He drafts two documents simultaneously: one on a phased AI rollout for the CEO, and another on career paths in the AI era for his team.  
* **Design Implications**  
  * Needs enterprise-grade tools with audit trails and compliance features.  
  * Values frameworks that balance innovation with risk management.  
  * Requires change management resources alongside technical documentation.  
  * Seeks peer networks at similar scale/complexity organizations.
