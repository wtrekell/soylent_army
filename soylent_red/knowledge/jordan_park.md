  * Values: Human dignity, systemic integrity, equity, long-term impact  
  * Personality: Deeply empathetic and methodical; a natural facilitator who is unafraid to challenge assumptions and halt processes that risk causing harm.  
  * Attitudes: Believes AI is a powerful material for service design but carries immense systemic risk if not implemented with rigorous human-centered and ethical oversight. Views technology through a lens of social justice.  
* **Personal Behaviors**  
  * Personal experience navigating healthcare as a non-binary person—constantly correcting forms and explaining their identity to providers—makes them acutely aware of how poorly designed systems can perpetuate bias and cause harm.  
* **Underlying Motivations**  
  * To establish an industry-wide benchmark for ethical, inclusive AI in healthcare service design; to ensure technology serves humanity, not the other way around.
## 2. Their Profession
This section covers the individual's work life, including their role, responsibilities, and professional environment.
* **Role & Environment**  
  * Role: Senior Service Designer  
  * Company Type & Size: Healthcare Technology Company  
* **Experience**  
  * Years of Experience: 12 years  
  * AI Adoption Stage: Systems Integration (holistic implementation)  
* **Tools & Technology**  
  * Specific Tools Used: Miro, Figma  
  * Workflow Habits: Creates comprehensive service blueprints that explicitly annotate AI touchpoints with "bias checkpoints" and potential "AI failure modes." Maintains and consults a curated panel of "edge case personas." Their primary test for new AI tools is to feed them data from edge case personas to check for biased outputs.  
* **Team & Collaboration**  
  * Facilitates workshops and navigates between the Product team's push for innovation and the Legal team's mandate to avoid risk.  
* **Professional Goals**  
  * Immediate Goals: Prevent the deployment of a biased AI symptom checker by providing data-driven evidence of its risks to marginalized communities.  
  * Mid-Term Goals (Quarterly/Annual): Successfully pilot one AI-augmented service journey that demonstrably improves patient equity and accessibility.

## 4. Narrative Elements
This section contains the qualitative data that brings the persona to life, including their story, challenges, and measures of success.
* **Biography**  
  * Jordan’s career began in urban planning, where they first honed their skills in mapping complex human systems. They transitioned to service design, bringing a unique perspective to a major healthcare technology company that is "all-in on AI." This lived experience fuels their professional mission. The company’s culture is progressive on paper but often stumbles in practice, an environment that has taught Jordan the patience and persistence required to advocate for systemic change.  
* **Pain Points (Ranked by Impact)**  
  1. **High-Stakes Ethical Hazards:** Terrified that a biased AI tool they are pressured to deploy could lead to a real-world misdiagnosis for a patient from an underrepresented group, causing direct physical harm.  
  2. **Stakeholder Gridlock:** Caught between the Product team's mandate to "innovate with AI everywhere" and the Legal team's mandate to "avoid all AI risk," leading to strategic paralysis.  
  3. **AI's Contextual Blindness:** Frustrated by AI's inability to grasp critical human context (e.g., a patient's need for extra time due to a mobility issue), forcing constant manual overrides.  
  4. **Organizational Inertia:** Spends significant emotional labor navigating a well-meaning but flawed corporate culture, from correcting colleagues' use of pronouns to fighting for resources for inclusive user testing.  
* **Budget & Purchasing Authority**  
  * Personal/Team Tool Budget: $500-1,000/month  
  * Training/Course Budget: $5,000-10,000/year  
  * Conference Budget: 2-3 events (prefer inclusive venues)  
* **Success Indicators**  
  * Systemic impact: Measured across full service journey  
  * Bias reduction metrics: Documented improvement required  
  * Stakeholder alignment: Cross-functional adoption \>60%  
  * Community contribution: Active knowledge sharing  
* **Key Quote**  
  * "The question isn't whether AI belongs in service design. The question is: whose values are we encoding when we design these systems?"  
* **Scenario**  
  * Monday morning, Jordan stares at the service blueprint sprawling across three walls of the design studio. They've been tasked with reimagining the entire patient onboarding journey with AI woven throughout. The challenge isn't just technical—it's philosophical. The real friction comes from competing visions. Product wants AI everywhere for efficiency. Legal wants it nowhere for liability. Jordan's job is to find the path that honors both concerns while keeping patient needs central.  
* **Design Implications**  
  * Needs tools that support complex systems mapping and can visualize the interplay between human and AI touchpoints.  
  * Values frameworks and checklists for ethical AI auditing, particularly those focused on bias detection in healthcare.  
  * Requires facilitation guides and templates for running inclusive design workshops and aligning stakeholders.  
  * Seeks communities of practice focused on service design ethics and technology for social impact.
