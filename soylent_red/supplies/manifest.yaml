  - Use all files in knowledge/examples/ as reference to style, tone, and the approximate length of content for this draft.
  - CRITICAL: DO NOT write as "I" - this fabricates personal experiences. Use [AUTHOR: add personal example] annotations instead.
  - Match structure and section depth to these examples unless instructed otherwise.
  - When personal experience would strengthen content, annotate with [TODO: author experience needed].
  - Remember to flag any content requiring my personal commentary as TODO.
  - Use supplied materials only—do not fabricate context, examples, or personal anecdotes.
  - Focus on documented techniques and research findings rather than invented personal stories.
