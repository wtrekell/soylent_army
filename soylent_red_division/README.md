#### Step 2: Provide Feedback and Iterate
```bash
feedback "path/to/DRAFT_file.md" "Your conversational feedback here"
```
**Examples of feedback:**
- `"This feels too technical for the Adaptive Alex persona. Can you make it more accessible?"`
- `"The introduction doesn't hook me. I want more of the transparent practitioner voice."`
- `"The examples need more ethical considerations woven in, not just mentioned."`
- `"This section is perfect, but the conclusion feels rushed. Can you expand it?"`

#### Step 3: Sign Off When Ready
```bash
signoff "path/to/DRAFT_file.md" "This looks great, ready for my personal editing"
```

### Direct Content Creation (Alternative)

#### Basic Content Creation
```bash
crewai run "Write a guide about AI prompt engineering for UX designers"
```

#### With Existing Content File
```bash
crewai run path/to/research/ai-ux-integration.md
```

#### With YAML Configuration
```bash
crewai run path/to/article-config.yaml
```

#### YAML Configuration Format
```yaml
title: "The Future of AI in UX Design"
context: "Based on 6 months of testing AI tools in design workflows"
requirements: "Create actionable guide for mid-level UX designers"
audience: "Adaptive Alex persona - 5 years UX experience"
format: "markdown"
raw_content: "Research findings and testing results..."
```

#### Task-Level LLM Override Example
```yaml
creative_writing_task:
  description: "Create experimental narrative content..."
  llm:
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    provider: "anthropic"
    temperature: 0.3
    max_tokens: 8192
    reason: "Requires advanced creative capabilities"
  expected_output: "Innovative content that pushes creative boundaries"
  agent: writer
```

## Testing

### Quick System Validation

To validate that all core systems are working correctly:

```bash
python3 tests/test_core_functionality.py
```

This lightweight test runner validates:
- ‚úÖ Project structure and configuration
- ‚úÖ Memory management operations  
- ‚úÖ Knowledge integration functionality
- ‚úÖ Reasoning and planning system
- ‚úÖ Validation and guardrails system

**No dependencies required** - runs with standard Python libraries.

### Comprehensive Testing

For full testing with pytest (requires dependency resolution):

```bash
# Install minimal testing dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-mock PyYAML

# Run comprehensive test suite (149 test cases across 10 files)
# Note: May require resolving CrewAI dependency conflicts
pytest tests/ -v
```

See `tests/README.md` for detailed testing documentation.
