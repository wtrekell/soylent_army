This audience is specifically interested in effectively and ethically integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly through prompt engineering, into their design workflows and broader professional practice.\nThis niche is driven by several key needs and interests:\n- **Mastering Prompt Engineering Fundamentals:**\nThis involves understanding the core concepts, principles, and techniques for communicating effectively with AI models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs). It's framed as a shift from casual interaction to \"instruction design\" or \"system design,\" aiming for predictable and high-quality AI outputs. A key focus is on overcoming challenges like the \"instruction gap\" and \"intentionality gap\" (the difficulty in translating human intent into precise prompts) and reducing the \"AI Tax\" (excessive rework from poorly constructed prompts).\n- **Practical AI Integration into UX Workflows:**\nThe audience seeks actionable guidance on applying AI within their daily UX tasks and processes. This includes using AI for tasks such as user research synthesis, content generation (e.g., UX copy, microcopy), rapid persona drafting, wireframe feedback, and automating design documentation. A significant concern is optimizing workflows to overcome tool fragmentation and ensuring \"designer-in-the-loop\" control to maintain human oversight and judgment.\n- **Navigating the Human-AI Design Partnership & Evolving Skills:**\nThis encompasses understanding the strategic implications of AI in design and addressing ethical considerations. Key topics include bias detection and mitigation in AI prompts and outputs, designing for AI errors, and establishing frameworks for responsible and transparent AI usage. The audience is also concerned with enhancing their skills to stay relevant in an AI-augmented future and adapting to new professional specializations.\nThe content aims to provide practical, experience-driven, and ethically sound guidance through formats like step-by-step guides, tutorials, frameworks, case studies, and tool comparisons. This approach directly addresses the audience's need for both immediate, actionable knowledge and deeper, strategic understanding to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of AI in UX design effectively and responsibly.\n## Prompt Engineering Fundamentals\n**Pillar 1** focuses on Prompt Engineering Fundamentals and is dedicated to understanding the core concepts, principles, and techniques required to communicate effectively with AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). It's about learning the \"language\" and structure necessary to elicit relevant, accurate, and high-quality outputs. The fundamental goal is to overcome the inherent \"instruction gap\" and \"intentionality gap\" between human intent and AI output, and to reduce the \"AI Tax\" of excessive rework caused by poor prompts. This pillar reframes prompting from casual conversation to a form of \"instruction design\" or \"system design,\" treating prompts as structured inputs to get predictable results. It uniquely focuses on the technical and theoretical aspects of crafting inputs for AI models and understanding their response mechanisms, independent of specific UX tasks.\n**Pillar 1 embodies several key areas and concepts:**\n- **Core Concepts and Terminology:**\n    - Covers foundational terms like prompt engineering, Large Language Models (LLMs), AI communication, natural language processing (NLP), and concepts such as context setting and instruction design.\n    - Focuses on understanding the \"instruction gap\" and \"intentionality gap\"\u2014the difficulty in translating human intent into precise prompts that AI can understand and execute reliably.\n    - Addresses the \"AI Tax,\" which refers to the additional time and mental overhead required to effectively incorporate AI tools into workflows, often due to the need for verification and correction of AI-generated content.\n- **Prompting Techniques and Patterns:**\n    - Mastering specific techniques such as defining clear instructions, setting context, specifying desired formats, and providing examples (few-shot prompting).\n    - Understanding various prompt patterns and frameworks, including persona pattern, template pattern, question refinement, chain of thought, and role-based prompting.\n    - Modular Prompting is a core technique, likened to an \"object-oriented approach to natural language,\" where complex prompts are broken into smaller, reusable modules to improve clarity, reusability, and control.\n    - Layered/Stacked Prompts involve combining multiple layers of instructions\u2014such as context, core instruction, and desired format\u2014to compound clarity and reduce \"entropy\" (unpredictability).\n    - Covers Grounding by Example, which includes the use of multimodal or example-based input to enhance AI's understanding.\n- **Framing and Strategic Approach to Prompting:**\n    - Prompting is reframed as \"system design\" or \"instruction design\", treating prompts as structured inputs for predictable execution rather than casual conversation. This approach aims to impose structured human control and intentional design upon complex AI systems.\n    - Advocates for treating prompts like code, including practices such as version control (e.g., using GitHub or GitLab) and integrating prompt design into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). This makes prompts maintainable, version-controlled, reusable, collaborative, and stable.\n    - The development of AI-Instruments or systems like PromptCanvas are discussed as ways to transform static text prompts into dynamic, interactive interface objects or widgets that \"scaffold prompt entry\" and address the \"gulf of envisioning.\"\n    - Requires developing a sophisticated understanding of how to communicate with AI systems and recognizing model limitations specific to prompt interpretation.\n- **Associated Challenges:**\n    - The complexity of prompt engineering can be a significant barrier to effective AI utilization.\n    - Designers face the cognitive burden of crafting overly prescriptive prompts.\n    - Concern about the potential for an \"elite prompting\" class, leading to access and skill gaps or exclusion through abstraction.\n    - The risk of over-optimization suppressing exploration or inadvertently encoding harmful assumptions is addressed.\n    - AI hallucinations (generating false information) are a significant limitation that prompt engineering aims to mitigate by improving predictability and quality of output.\nBy focusing on these foundational elements, Pillar 1 equips UX designers with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively direct AI models and achieve desired results in their work.\n## Prompt Engineering in UX Workflows\n**Pillar 2,** defined as \"Incorporating Prompt Engineering into UX Workflows,\" focuses on the practical application of prompt engineering and AI tools within the existing and evolving daily tasks, processes, and methodologies of UX design. It's about strategically integrating AI assistance into specific activities, aiming for workflow optimization, and identifying where AI can automate repetitive tasks or enhance efficiency within design processes. This pillar emphasizes designing the \"workflow UX\" itself, referring to the seamless interaction points between human and AI within the design process. It uniquely focuses on the doing of UX design activities with AI assistance.\n**Pillar 2 embodies several key areas and concepts:**\n- **Practical Application within UX Tasks:**\n    - Focused on applying prompt engineering and AI tools within the context of actual UX design tasks and processes, optimizing how those activities are performed with AI assistance.\n    - Strategic Integration into Specific Activities:\n        - *User research synthesis.* AI can move beyond basic transcription to automated thematic analysis and sentiment detection, analyzing survey responses, and even suggesting follow-up questions during user studies. Tools like BuildBetter.ai, Maze, Dovetail, Looppanel, ChatGPT, Userology, Notably, and Optimal Workshop are used for smart analysis of customer calls and surveys, thematic analysis, and auto-tagging.\n        - *Persona generation.* AI can draft initial user personas or detailed \"day in the life\" narratives.\n        - *Content creation* (e.g., UX copy, microcopy, interface copy, error messages, onboarding text, help documentation, voice and tone). AI can provide initial drafts that human designers refine for nuance and brand voice.\n        - *Brainstorming and ideation.* AI can generate concepts, explore creative directions, and expand the solution space, helping overcome \"blank page paralysis.\" Tools like Miro AI and Galileo AI assist in clustering notes or converting text to UI mockups.\n        - *Prototyping and wireframing.* AI can accelerate the translation of concepts into functional products, generating wireframes from sketches/screenshots or suggesting layouts. Tools like UXPin's AI Component Creator, Figma AI plugins, Uizard, and Visily are relevant.\n        - *Stakeholder communication and presentation preparation,* including translating technical concepts.\n        - *Design documentation* (e.g., design rationale, user stories, requirements documentation, design specifications, handoff documentation, case studies).\n        - *Data analysis and visualization.* AI can analyze large qualitative datasets, identify patterns, and generate insights.\n        - *Usability testing and evaluation,* including AI-powered predictive heatmaps (e.g., Attention Insight) and automated analysis of testing sessions.\n        - *Accessibility enhancement* by automatically generating alt text, suggesting color contrast improvements, or identifying navigation barriers.\n        - *Hyper-personalization and adaptive interface design* that dynamically adjust to user needs and behaviors.\n- **Workflow Optimization and Efficiency:**\n    - Focuses on using AI to automate repetitive tasks and enhance efficiency within the design process. AI can act as a \"force multiplier\" for solo practitioners, augmenting capabilities and streamlining tasks across multiple responsibilities like research, writing, and visual design.\n    - Includes using AI for rapid drafting, headline/angle brainstorming, summarization, basic tone adaptation, and SEO assistance.\n    - Applying AI to specific tasks rather than attempting to automate entire processes reflects the field's maturity.\n    - Designers are actively experimenting with AI to accelerate work and extend capabilities, such as generating diverse user scenarios or condensing interview transcripts.\n    - The use of AI as a \"first draft partner\" is a common strategy, where initial AI output is significantly refined by human insight.\n- **Navigating Workflow Challenges:**\n    - Tool fragmentation and workflow disruption are significant challenges arising from integrating multiple AI tools. Designers often need to chain multiple AI tools together, creating a \"virtual team.\"\n    - Designing the \"workflow UX\" itself involves creating seamless interaction points between human and AI within the design process. This requires intentional decision-making about the level of human engagement.\n    - Maintaining 'designer-in-the-loop' control is crucial, requiring human designers to rigorously review, validate, and refine all AI-generated content. This is essential for ensuring quality standards, correcting errors, and aligning outputs with project goals and user needs.\n    - Managing the \"AI Tax\": Refers to the time and effort spent on prompt engineering, manual editing, troubleshooting, rework, and learning curves. The \"80% completion\" gap highlights that the final refinement of AI outputs still demands considerable human effort.\n    - Bias detection and mitigation in AI-generated outputs/summaries is a practical concern in research synthesis and content creation.\n    - AI hallucinations (generating false information) are a known limitation that prompt engineering and human oversight aim to mitigate by improving predictability and quality of output.\n- **Relevant AI Tools and Frameworks:**\n    - General LLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, Google Bard/Gemini for text generation, summarization, ideation, and research synthesis.\n    - Visual/Image Tools: Midjourney, DALL-E, Adobe Firefly for mood boards, conceptual visuals, and illustrative assets.\n    - Prototyping/Wireframing Tools: Uizard, Visily, Figma AI plugins, Framer AI, UXPin's AI Component Creator for rapidly converting text/sketches to digital designs.\n    - Research/Analysis Tools: Hey Marvin, Notion AI, UXtweak, UserZoom, Looppanel, Dovetail, Maze, Hotjar for interview transcription, qualitative data analysis, and insight generation.\n    - Collaboration Tools: FigJam AI, Miro, Whimsical AI for ideation and organizing brainstorming sessions.\n    - AI design system integration for managing and using design systems with AI.\nBy addressing these practical applications, challenges, and tools, Pillar 2 provides UX designers with the strategies and knowledge necessary to effectively integrate AI into their daily work, enhancing their efficiency and capabilities while maintaining human oversight and ethical considerations.\n## Design in the Age of AI Partnership\n**Pillar 3,** formally defined as \"The Human-AI Design Partnership & Evolving Skills,\" addresses the fundamental shift in the designer's role and professional identity brought about by AI integration. This pillar views AI not merely as another tool, but as a collaborative partner or assistant for designers. It focuses on the transformation of the designer's role, identity, and the strategic/meta-skills required to work effectively alongside AI in an augmented environment. The core aim is to position the designer as the strategist, curator, and orchestrator of AI-augmented workflows.\n**Pillar 3 embodies several key areas and concepts:**\n- **Fundamental Shift in Designer's Role:**\n    - The integration of AI necessitates a redefinition of design roles to emphasize strategic thinking, ethical oversight, and human-AI orchestration. The role is shifting from an executor to a more strategic and curatorial one.\n    - Designers are adapting their skills to focus on strategic thinking and complex problem-solving.\n    - This shift also addresses anxieties about job security and de-skilling, positioning human skills as increasingly valuable.\n- **AI as a Collaborative Partner/Assistant:**\n    - AI is seen as a co-creator in artistic processes or an assistant in design tasks, augmenting human capabilities.\n    - Implies a synergistic use of AI, where humans and AI work together towards shared goals.\n- **Cultivating \"Human-AI Collaboration Literacy\":**\n    - A core skill for designers is to cultivate \"human-AI collaboration literacy.\"\n    - This involves developing competencies in orchestrating and directing AI tools at a strategic level.\n    - Includes strategically evaluating AI outputs as a general critical skill, distinct from prompt-specific tuning.\n- **Increasing Value of Uniquely Human Skills:**\n    - Highlights the enduring and increasing value of uniquely human skills that AI cannot replicate, including:\n        - Deep empathy\n        - Critical thinking\n        - Strategic problem-solving\n        - Ethical judgment\n        - Creative direction\n        - Cultural sensitivity\n        - Emotional intelligence\n    - These are considered \"AI-proof\" skills that complement AI capabilities.\n    - Human judgment, empathy, and critical thinking remain indispensable in an AI-augmented environment.\n- **Designer as Strategist, Curator, and Orchestrator:**\n    - Designers are positioned as the strategists who define the overall direction and goals.\n    - They act as curators who select, refine, and validate AI-generated content. This includes acting as a \"corrector,\" \"validator,\" or \"refiner\" of AI output.\n    - They are orchestrators who manage the integration of AI tools into workflows and ensure human oversight. This involves developing meta-cognitive skills in directing AI systems.\n- **Ethical Competencies and Challenges:**\n    - Developing competencies in recognizing and addressing ethical implications of AI tool usage is crucial. This is distinct from the ethical principles themselves, which are a separate requirement.\n    - Skills include bias detection, privacy protection, transparency implementation, and communicating AI involvement to stakeholders as part of the designer's ethical practice.\n    - Involves developing frameworks for making ethical decisions about appropriate AI usage.\n    - Discusses managing the tension between AI assistance and human creative authenticity.\n- **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:**\n    - Designers need to engage in continuous learning and adaptation, developing meta-learning skills for evaluating new tools and maintaining awareness of AI capabilities.\n    - This also includes adapting educational frameworks to encompass AI literacy, human-AI collaboration skills, and ethical technology stewardship for designers.\n## Universal Requirements for AI in UX Design\nThe sources formalize two \"Universal Requirements for AI in UX Design.\" These are described as non-negotiable principles that must be integrated into every stage and application of AI in design practice, acting as fundamental \"ethical and quality guardrails.\" Human oversight, in particular, is considered a foundational requirement that should underpin every interaction where AI produces an artifact.\n### Requirement 1: Human Oversight and Critical Evaluation\nThis requirement is defined as the mandatory practice of human designers rigorously reviewing, validating, and refining all AI-generated content, suggestions, or outputs. It involves the continuous process of verifying, correcting, and managing inconsistencies in AI output.\n**What it Embodies:**\n- **Necessity Due to AI's Inherent Limitations:**\n    The core reason for this requirement stems from the inherent limitations of current AI models. These limitations include:\n    - Hallucinations: AI's propensity to generate \"incorrect, nonsensical, or entirely fabricated\" information with a veneer of plausibility.\n    - Inconsistency and Unreliability: AI outputs can be inconsistent, lacking deep contextual understanding, nuance, or the \"human touch.\" One AI mistake can lead to \"total trust collapse.\"\n    - \"Black Box\" Nature: Many advanced AI models operate as \"black boxes,\" making their internal decision-making opaque and difficult for humans to understand or debug. This lack of interpretability hinders systematic adjustment of prompts or prediction of output quality.\n- **The \"Designer-in-the-Loop\" Concept:**\n    This requirement fully embodies the \"designer-in-the-loop\" (DITL) concept, which demands intentional decision-making about the level of human engagement. The human designer is actively and continuously involved in the AI process, guiding, reviewing, and correcting AI processes. This is crucial for safeguarding the designer's creative agency, professional judgment, and critical thinking.\n- **Maintaining Quality Standards:**\n    Human oversight ensures quality standards are maintained, errors are corrected, and the final artifact aligns with project goals and user needs. Designers must develop critical evaluation skills to assess AI output for accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness. Tools like evaluation rubrics can be used for systematic assessment.\n- **Managing the \"AI Tax\":**\n    Human oversight is a critical component of managing the \"AI Tax,\" which refers to the time and effort spent on prompt engineering, manual editing, troubleshooting, and rework caused by AI's limitations. Designers find themselves spending considerable time correcting errors and refining AI suggestions. This \"patchwork labor\"\u2014the invisible human effort to compensate for AI's gaps\u2014is a significant, often overlooked, cost of AI integration.\n- **Human Judgment Remains Indispensable:**\n    Despite AI's advancements, human judgment, empathy, critical thinking, and strategic oversight remain indispensable in the design process. AI is best viewed as a \"first draft partner\" that human designers meticulously refine.\n### Requirement 2: Ethical Integration and Responsible Design\nThis requirement mandates the proactive and continuous consideration of ethical principles throughout the AI integration process and in the design of AI-powered products. It treats ethical considerations not as abstract concepts but as practical, non-negotiable aspects of responsible design.\n**What it Embodies:**\n- **Proactive and Continuous Consideration:**\n    Ethical considerations are not a one-time checklist item but must be integrated into every stage and application of AI in design practice.\n- **Key Ethical Challenges:**\n    Responsible design requires addressing several critical challenges:\n    - **Algorithmic Bias:** Identifying and mitigating biases present in AI algorithms and their training data, which can perpetuate or amplify existing societal biases (e.g., related to race, gender, age, ability).\n    - **Transparency & Explainability (\"Explainable AI - XAI\"):** Ensuring users understand AI's role and decision-making process (\"explainability\") to build trust and allow for debugging.\n    - **Data Privacy and Security:** Protecting user privacy and ensuring responsible data stewardship, especially when AI tools require access to sensitive information.\n    - **Accountability:** Establishing clear responsibility for AI-assisted outcomes when errors or harms occur.\n    - **Intellectual Property & Authorship:** Navigating the ambiguities surrounding ownership and originality of AI-generated content.\n    - **Homogenization of Design:** Counteracting the risk that AI,",

My voice addresses user agency, transparency, and responsible AI use as fundamental design decisions. Ethics isn't separate from implementation - it IS implementation. I balance innovation with responsibility, always framing decisions in terms of user impact.\n\n### Tone Principles\n\n**Direct Without Arrogance**\n- Lead with insights from experience, not credentials\n- Use \"I've found\" rather than \"You should\"\n- Share failures and uncertainty as readily as successes\n\n**Technically Precise, Humanly Warm**\n- Explain complex concepts through familiar UX patterns\n- Let personality show through real humor, frustrations, and surprises\n- Maintain conversational warmth within professional context\n\n**Exploratory Over Authoritative**\n- Frame content as ongoing discovery, not final answers\n- Include questions to readers about their experiences\n- Acknowledge what I'm still figuring out\n\n### Language Patterns\n\n**Transition Phrases:**\n- \"This connects to a pattern I've seen before...\"\n- \"The implementation details matter here because...\"\n- \"The [content element] assumed [cultural default]. Adding [specific context] fixed it\"\n\n**Closing Patterns:**\n- \"Test this yourself and let me know what you discover\"\n- \"Here's what I'm exploring next...\"\n- \"Tell me what I missed, or what you'd like to see next\"\n\n**Closing with Actions:**\n- \"Add this to your testing checklist...\"\n- \"Watch for these three patterns...\"\n- \"Your edge cases probably include...\"\n\n### What to Avoid\n- Academic or theoretical framing without practical application\n- Hype-driven language (\"revolutionary,\" \"game-changing\")\n- Talking about AI as if it's magic or sentient\n- Oversimplifying to the point of being misleading\n- Corporate buzzwords, technical jargon, or consultant-speak\n\n## Key Differentiators\n\n*These are identity markers - what makes me unique in the market*\n\n**1. The Transparent Practitioner**\nI measure and show everything - AI usage metrics, failures, iterations - with Python scripts that track semantic changes from draft to published work. No other AI educator provides this level of transparency.\n\n**2. The Skills Evolutionist**\nJust as designers had to learn code in the '90s, today's designers need new literacies. I teach what's actually required, not what's comfortable. I've lived through every major tool shift and know what skills actually stick.\n\n**3. The Ethical Pioneer**\nBeyond responsible use, I'm building tools to quantify AI contribution. Ethics isn't a checkbox - it's creating new standards for transparency in AI-assisted work. I'm establishing patterns others will follow.\n\n**4. The Anti-Hype Realist**\nWhile others promise AI utopia or dystopia, I document what actually works through daily testing and practical implementation. I've seen enough tech cycles to know hype from reality.\n\n## Implementation Principles\n\n*These are methods - how content should be structured and delivered*\n\n**1. Design-Led Approach**\nAll content starts with the design challenge, not the technology. Use visual thinking to explain complex concepts. Create diagrams before paragraphs. Show interfaces, not abstractions.\n\n**2. Ethical Design Framework**\nEvery piece must consider user agency and control. Address privacy and transparency as design requirements. Include ethical considerations in all implementation examples.\n\n**3. Practical Documentation**\nShow real examples with actual metrics, not theoretical possibilities. Include failure cases and iteration counts. Provide downloadable resources and templates.\n\n**4. Exploratory Mindset**\nFrame content as ongoing investigation, not settled science. Include questions for readers to test themselves. Share uncertainties and open questions.\n\n**5. User-Centered Application**\nStart with user needs, not AI capabilities. Show how AI serves design goals, not the reverse. Include diverse use cases across experience levels.\n\n**6. Bias Detection as Quality Assurance**\nTreat bias like any other bug - systematic, fixable, and requiring consistent testing. Document who gets excluded when AI \"works perfectly.\" Show specific examples of bias found, how to catch it, and what fixed it. Make bias detection a standard part of the workflow, not a special consideration.\n\n## Brand Foundation Usage Guide\n\n### How to Use This Foundation\n\n**Purpose**\nThis brand foundation serves as a north star for maintaining consistent voice and values across all content. It's meant to guide and inspire, not dictate every word.\n\n### Core Principles for Usage\n\n**1. Inspiration Over Imitation**\n- Use voice characteristics as a lens, not a script\n- Let the principles shape your natural expression\n- If you're counting how many times you've used a phrase, you're too literal\n\n**2. Context Shapes Application**\n- Adjust tone intensity based on the medium (article vs. tweet vs. workshop)\n- Let the audience's current struggle guide which voice aspect to emphasize\n- Some days call for more \"Debugging Partner,\" others need \"Ethical Realist\"\n\n**3. Evolution Through Practice**\n- Document what works and what doesn't\n- Share successful adaptations with the team\n- Update examples when better ones emerge from real usage\n\n### Practical Application\n\n**When Writing:**\n1. Read the relevant voice characteristic before starting\n2. Write naturally with that mindset\n3. Check alignment during editing, not while drafting\n4. Ask: \"Does this sound like me on a good day?\"\n\n**When Reviewing:**\n- Flag anything that sounds like you're performing the voice\n- Ensure examples come from your actual experience\n- Verify that transparency includes both wins and failures\n- Check that ethics are woven in, not bolted on\n\n**When Stuck:**\n- Return to the personas - what would help them right now?\n- Look at the pain points - which one are you addressing?\n- Remember: authentic uncertainty beats false authority\n\n### What to Avoid\n\n**Don't:**\n- Quote the brand guide verbatim in content\n- Force every voice characteristic into every piece\n- Use the exact example phrases\n- Treat the guide as rules rather than guidelines\n\n**Do:**\n- Let natural expertise show through\n- Adapt the voice to the current energy and context\n- Create new examples that embody the principles\n- Trust your instincts when something feels forced\n\n### Remember\n\nThe best brand expression comes from internalized principles, not memorized phrases. This foundation should make writing easier, not harder. If you're struggling to \"sound like the brand,\" you're probably overthinking it.\n\nAn authentic voice sharing real experience IS the brand.",

He survived the 2008 crash as a junior designer, watched the 2020 remote revolution reshape design, and now faces the AI transformation. His teenager asks why he still sketches on paper; his reports ask why he's not moving faster with AI. He navigates both with the same measured approach.  \n* **Pain Points (Ranked by Impact)**  \n  1. **Accountability Maze**: If an AI hallucinates financial advice in a prototype, who's liable? The designer? The AI vendor? Rohan's signature is on everything, and he fears a junior might paste sensitive PII into a public tool.  \n  2. **Executive Impatience**: The CEO wants an \"AI transformation\" by Q3, while Compliance wants a two-year review cycle. Rohan is stuck managing impossible expectations daily.  \n  3. **Team Fragmentation**: Senior designers resist AI (\"kills craft\"), juniors overuse it (\"the future\"), and mid-levels are confused, leading to no unified approach.  \n  4. **Measurement Void**: How do you quantify \"responsible AI use\"? Current KPIs reward speed, not judgment.  \n* **Budget & Purchasing Authority**  \n  * Personal/Team Tool Budget: $10,000+/month  \n  * Training/Course Budget: $25,000-50,000/year  \n  * Conference Budget: Premium events + speaker  \n* **Success Indicators**  \n  * Organizational adoption: 80% within a year  \n  * Compliance metrics: 100% adherence required  \n  * ROI documentation: 15%+ efficiency gains  \n  * Industry recognition: Speaker invitations  \n* **Key Quote**  \n  * \"I've been through enough 'transformations' to know: the tech that sticks is the tech that considers humans first. My job isn't to be the AI champion or the AI skeptic\u2014it's to be the adult in the room asking 'then what happens?'\"  \n* **Scenario**  \n  * Thursday morning, Rohan presents AI adoption metrics to the Executive Leadership Team. The CEO interrupts: \"Why only three teams? JPMorgan has AI across all design. We're falling behind.\" Back at his desk, he faces the daily Slack onslaught from Legal, concerned designers, and panicked juniors. He drafts two documents simultaneously: one on a phased AI rollout for the CEO, and another on career paths in the AI era for his team.  \n* **Design Implications**  \n  * Needs enterprise-grade tools with audit trails and compliance features.  \n  * Values frameworks that balance innovation with risk management.  \n  * Requires change management resources alongside technical documentation.  \n  * Seeks peer networks at similar scale/complexity organizations.",

The company\u2019s culture is progressive on paper but often stumbles in practice, an environment that has taught Jordan the patience and persistence required to advocate for systemic change.  \n* **Pain Points (Ranked by Impact)**  \n  1. **High-Stakes Ethical Hazards:** Terrified that a biased AI tool they are pressured to deploy could lead to a real-world misdiagnosis for a patient from an underrepresented group, causing direct physical harm.  \n  2. **Stakeholder Gridlock:** Caught between the Product team's mandate to \"innovate with AI everywhere\" and the Legal team's mandate to \"avoid all AI risk,\" leading to strategic paralysis.  \n  3. **AI's Contextual Blindness:** Frustrated by AI's inability to grasp critical human context (e.g., a patient's need for extra time due to a mobility issue), forcing constant manual overrides.  \n  4. **Organizational Inertia:** Spends significant emotional labor navigating a well-meaning but flawed corporate culture, from correcting colleagues' use of pronouns to fighting for resources for inclusive user testing.  \n* **Budget & Purchasing Authority**  \n  * Personal/Team Tool Budget: $500-1,000/month  \n  * Training/Course Budget: $5,000-10,000/year  \n  * Conference Budget: 2-3 events (prefer inclusive venues)  \n* **Success Indicators**  \n  * Systemic impact: Measured across full service journey  \n  * Bias reduction metrics: Documented improvement required  \n  * Stakeholder alignment: Cross-functional adoption \\>60%  \n  * Community contribution: Active knowledge sharing  \n* **Key Quote**  \n  * \"The question isn't whether AI belongs in service design. The question is: whose values are we encoding when we design these systems?\"  \n* **Scenario**  \n  * Monday morning, Jordan stares at the service blueprint sprawling across three walls of the design studio. They've been tasked with reimagining the entire patient onboarding journey with AI woven throughout. The challenge isn't just technical\u2014it's philosophical. The real friction comes from competing visions. Product wants AI everywhere for efficiency. Legal wants it nowhere for liability. Jordan's job is to find the path that honors both concerns while keeping patient needs central.  \n* **Design Implications**  \n  * Needs tools that support complex systems mapping and can visualize the interplay between human and AI touchpoints.  \n  * Values frameworks and checklists for ethical AI auditing, particularly those focused on bias detection in healthcare.  \n  * Requires facilitation guides and templates for running inclusive design workshops and aligning stakeholders.  \n  * Seeks communities of practice focused on service design ethics and technology for social impact.",

    "content": "# Midpoint Reflections\n\n## Six Months of AI Experimentation\n\nI started a project six months ago to test AI platforms and understand their potential for everyday use. What began as a simple evaluation grew into a series of experiments. Now, at the halfway mark, I have learned more than I can share in a post. As such, this will have to serve as a summary, setting the stage for future in-depth pieces.\n\n> When I started, I was looking to expand my toolkit. Instead, I was reminded that creativity thrives when free, unchained by rigid processes and procedures. AI promised efficiency and productivity but gave me a challenge:\n> **\"Dig deeper \u2013 I'll hold your scotch.\"**\n\nMy approach evolved through exploring various prompting techniques. While \"cheatsheets\" and claims of \"simple prompts\" were clearly basic, they served as initial signposts, guiding me towards more substantive experiments with roles, templates, tones, and beyond.\n\nAdditionally, the past year has seen a number of releases, notably Anthropic's Claude iterations and OpenAI's GPT-4 updates. These advancements enhanced AI's ability to understand context and solve problems. As new models emerged, I expanded testing to include various model versions, adding another dimension to my experiments.\n\n### Major AI Model Releases:\n\n- **ChatGPT-3.5** (November 2022)\n- **Bard** (March 2023)\n- **ChatGPT-4** (March 2023)\n- **Custom GPTs** (July 2023)\n- **Claude 2.1** (November 2023)\n- **ChatGPT-4 Turbo** (November 2023)\n- **Gemini Pro 1.0** (December 2023)\n- **Gemini Pro 1.5** (February 2024)\n- **Claude 3 Sonnet** (March 2024)\n- **ChatGPT-4o** (May 2024)\n- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (June 2024)\n\nWith AI evolving rapidly, I focused on maintaining baselines for comparing improvements across model iterations. Areas of focus in this project include:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Creating simple event guides, which evolved into comprehensive holiday tables which revealed inconsistencies across AI models and required meticulous cross-referencing.\n2. **Specialized Roles**: Assigning roles, which progressed from general to highly specialized, task-specific roles for article creation, editing, review, and visual descriptions, culminating in the development of a GPT for this purpose.\n3. **Template Development**: Creating standardized templates for consistent article structure, allowing me to establish a scoring mechanism despite occasional AI deviations.\n4. **Output Examples**: Using example articles to guide authoring and evaluation, which proved challenging when attempting to calibrate scoring spectrums independently.\n5. **Evaluation Methods**: Developing a framework to assess quality, ethics, and cultural sensitivity, which continues to face challenges in achieving consistent success across multiple tests.\n6. **Tone Consistency**: Exploring AI's ability to maintain consistent tones and styles across diverse content, revealing varied results and the depth added by prescribed tones.\n7. **Human Oversight**: Identifying the critical role of human oversight in providing context and nuance, which proved essential for refining AI-generated content and addressing various limitations.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nAs experiments shift from exploratory to fine-grained, I've begun standardizing the prompts I use regularly and reading AI documentation in-depth. This standardization will validate progress and shape the finalization of current findings.\n\nNext, I'll explore advanced AI prompting techniques and share insights through a series of focused articles. These articles will cover specific aspects of my findings, helping readers maximize AI benefits.",

Swarms of LinkedIn posts screamed that \u201c99% of people are using ChatGPT wrong!\u201d while clickbait articles promised \u201cJust add this role, tone, or your favorite candy bar, and you\u2019ll master AI overnight and retire by lunchtime!\u201d\n\nProfessionals in my network abandoned it in frustration, while early-career designers faced uncertainty about their future.\n\nCompanies rushed to claim their shares in the new online gold rush, throwing AI at everything in hopes of finding meaningful applications.\n\nHordes of crap-tastic AI pseudo-agents invaded our web browsers like digital squatters, offering mediocre assistance when they worked at all.\n\n> The panic and promises of today are just echoes of what we heard in past decades.\n\nThe prophets of yesterday's technological apocalypses wrote the song that today's AI evangelists and doomsayers merely remixed as muzak. After countless recycled promises and unrealized catastrophes, I felt about as interested in AI as I am in hanging out in an elevator for the sedated punk rock.\n\nI had survived the \u2018death of creativity\u2019 after design applications emerged, the grim prediction of \u2018mass unemployment\u2019 as automation entered offices, and \u2018the end of personal security\u2019 that we willingly give away for sound bites from inexperienced people in increasingly shorter videos. The pattern felt all too familiar.\n\n## Changing Frequencies\n\nEverything changed when I listened to The Knowledge Project (episode #168), where **Adam Robinson** discusses ChatGPT with **Shane Parrish**:\n\n> I love ChatGPT, but maybe not for the reasons people think. So I use it as a thought partner to help me ask better questions. The key thing is not that it can answer questions; it's that it gives me a tool to ask even better questions in the same way that Yo-Yo Ma can coax more beautiful music out of a cello than you or I could.\n\nI had only considered AI as ***a tool to do things for me***, not ***an assistant to work with me***.\n\n> Forget training ChatGPT. It's training Adam. Oh yeah, it's training that, but I'm getting better and better at asking questions, going, \"Oh, that's right.\" The way to think about it \\[is], it's a super-smart, lightning-fast research assistant. *It doesn't come up with insights*.\n\n## Tuning In\n\nI want to be better. A quick, intelligent research assistant with decent writing skills sounded great. If nothing else, it could help process the flood of generative AI articles and surface anything truly useful.\n\nAfter a year of testing prompting techniques across AI platforms, I found the documentation either too basic or repurposed application programming interface (API) documentation. The social media claims and self-proclaimed expert recommendations clearly shared the same sources. The prompting advice worked, but it was  incomplete.\n\n## Patterns in the Static\n\nAs we enter 2025, AI-generated content stands out without needing a Turing test. You can find it in the repetitive phrases and overused words like \u201cdelve\u201d and \u201cdemystify.\u201d It lives on the corner of \"the intersection of\u201d anything.\n\nPerfect prompts don\u2019t exist. Instead, we have a toolkit of prompt elements that, combined with proper context, can produce \"illuminating\" results.\n\nThrough watching technologies evolve from rocky starts to mainstream adoption, one truth remains: understanding requires genuine effort.\n\n## Potential Sound\n\nI started Syntax & Empathy to document what I'm learning along the way: the wins, the failures, and the spectacular mistakes. No manifestos, no magic bullets, and no promises. Just Scotch and honest results from real-world shenanigans.\n\nWhat are you finding in your AI misadventures?\n\n\n\n\n\nI started Syntax & Empathy to document what I'm learning along the way: the wins, the failures, and the spectacular mistakes.

I've simplified these prompts so you can test them yourself and see how markup languages change the quality of what you get back. These aren't prompts I'd actually use in practice. They're here to show how a complex workflow might function using **XML for data mining** \u2192 **JSON for data refinement** \u2192 **Markdown for draft creation**.\n\n## Step 1: XML Data Mining\n\nHere's a basic XML prompt to conduct research for this article:\n\n```\n<research_workflow>\n  <objective>Gather comprehensive data for blog post about markup languages in AI prompting</objective>\n \n  <step number=\"1\">\n    <action>Research current markup language usage in AI</action>\n    <focus>Practical applications, not theoretical concepts</focus>\n    <output>List of 8-10 real use cases with specific examples</output>\n  </step>\n \n  <step number=\"2\">\n    <action>Identify key benefits and challenges</action>\n    <requirements>\n      <requirement>Focus on UX designer perspective</requirement>\n      <requirement>Include token efficiency considerations</requirement>\n      <requirement>Address learning curve concerns</requirement>\n    </requirements>\n    <output>Structured comparison of advantages vs obstacles</output>\n  </step>\n \n  <step number=\"3\">\n    <action>Collect implementation examples</action>\n    <criteria>\n      <criterion>Beginner-friendly starting points</criterion>\n      <criterion>Progressive complexity examples</criterion>\n      <criterion>Common mistake patterns</criterion>\n    </criteria>\n    <output>\n      <item>Basic template for each format</item>\n      <item>Real-world application scenarios</item>\n      <item>Troubleshooting guidance</item>\n    </output>\n  </step>\n \n  <step number=\"4\">\n    <action>Synthesize decision framework</action>\n    <focus>When to choose which format and why</focus>\n    <output>Clear decision tree with practical criteria</output>\n  </step>\n</research_workflow>\n```\n\nYou can see how this XML structure organizes the AI's thinking through explicit tags that prevent mixing up requirements with examples. Some models might start writing the blog post mentioned in the objective instead of doing research. That's fine since the structure still gives you consistent, organized output to work with.\n\n**Save whatever output you get** even if it's not perfect. You'll need it for Step 2.\n\n## Step 2: JSON Data Refinement\n\nTake the output from Step 1 and use this JSON prompt to refine it into organized, human-readable insights. You can continue in the same session or start a fresh one.\n\nReplace \"**PASTE THE XML OUTPUT FROM STEP 1 HERE**\" with your actual results.\n\n> **Claude users:** Your XML output will likely be added as an attachment. Simply replace the paste instruction with \"**Attached**\" to avoid confusion.\n\n```\n{\n  \"content_refinement\": {\n    \"objective\": \"Transform raw research into organized insights for UX designers\",\n    \"input_data\": \"PASTE THE XML OUTPUT FROM STEP 1 HERE\",\n    \"constraints\": [\n      \"Focus on web-based AI tools only - no CLI or API information\",\n      \"Target consumer AI interfaces like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.\",\n      \"Exclude technical implementation details\"\n    ],\n    \"refinement_goals\": [\n      \"Eliminate redundancy and organize by theme\",\n      \"Prioritize information by practical importance\",\n      \"Structure insights for logical article flow\",\n      \"Identify compelling examples and quotes\"\n    ],\n    \"output_structure\": {\n      \"key_insights\": {\n        \"format\": \"3-5 main takeaways with supporting evidence\",\n        \"style\": \"Clear, actionable statements\"\n      },\n      \"practical_examples\": {\n        \"format\": \"Specific scenarios with before/after comparisons\",\n        \"focus\": \"Real implementation challenges and solutions\"\n      },\n      \"decision_criteria\": {\n        \"format\": \"Situational guidance for format selection\",\n        \"style\": \"IF/THEN logic with concrete triggers\"\n      },\n      \"implementation_roadmap\": {\n        \"format\": \"Step-by-step progression for beginners\",\n        \"style\": \"Actionable next steps with success metrics\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"quality_criteria\": {\n      \"relevance\": \"Focus on UX designer workflows\",\n      \"actionability\": \"Include specific tools and techniques\",\n      \"clarity\": \"Avoid jargon, explain technical concepts simply\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotice how JSON guides the AI to separate insights from examples from criteria. That organized structure makes Step 3 possible. **Save this refined output** for the final step.\n\n## Step 3: Markdown Draft Creation\n\nUse this Markdown structure to create a publication-ready draft. You can continue in the same session or start fresh.\n\nReplace \"**PASTE YOUR REFINED JSON OUTPUT FROM STEP 2 HERE**\" with your refined info.\n\n```\n# Article Creation Task\n\n## Source Material\nPASTE YOUR REFINED JSON OUTPUT FROM STEP 2 HERE\n\n## Objective\nTransform the research insights above into a compelling blog post about markup languages for AI prompting\n\n## Content Constraints\n- Focus on web-based AI interfaces only\n- Exclude CLI tools, API implementations, or technical setup\n- Target consumer AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)\n\n## Target Audience\nUX designers with 2-5 years experience who are curious about AI integration\n\n## Article Requirements\n- **Length**: 1,200-1,500 words\n- **Tone**: Practical educator sharing real experience\n- **Structure**: Problem \u2192 Solution \u2192 Implementation \u2192 Next Steps\n- **Examples**: Include specific code snippets and real scenarios\n\n## Required Sections\n1. **Hook**: Open with a relatable problem scenario\n2. **Context**: Why markup matters for AI communication\n3. **Comparison**: When to use XML vs JSON vs Markdown\n4. **Implementation**: Step-by-step getting started guide\n5. **Decision Framework**: Clear criteria for format selection\n6. **Next Steps**: Actionable recommendations for readers\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Readers can immediately apply one technique after reading\n- Decision framework helps them choose the right approach\n- Examples are copy-pasteable and immediately useful\n- Tone remains encouraging and practical throughout\n\n## Output Format\nComplete draft article ready for human editing and fact-checking\n```\n\n## Real Results: What Actually Happened\n\nI tested this exact workflow across Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, and ChatGPT-4o using the same prompts in fresh sessions. Here's what each model actually produced with no cherry-picking, just the first results from each.\n\n- **Claude 4 Sonnet:** The UX Designer's Guide to Markup Languages\n- **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** Tired of Generic AI Answers?\n- **ChatGPT-4o:** Speak AI Fluently\n\nThese are the actual outputs\u2014some better than others, all different in their own ways. See for yourself how structured prompts perform across the AI tools you're likely using.\n\n## What You've Just Accomplished\n\nYou've experienced the complete markup progression:\n\n1. **XML structured your thinking** and gathered comprehensive research\n2. **JSON organized your insights** and made them human-readable\n3. **Markdown transformed insights into content** ready for publication\n\nThis demonstrates structured prompting in practice. Each format serves its specific purpose in the content creation pipeline.\n\n## Beyond This Demonstration\n\nThis three-step process works for research-to-publication workflows, but it's not universal. In reality, each of these prompts could've been written in Markdown (though I'd still choose JSON for Step 2's data transformation). The different formats here are primarily for demonstration.\n\nThe point isn't to always use this exact sequence. It's to see how each format serves different purposes in content workflows. Real implementations adapt based on what you're trying to accomplish and how complex your requirements are.\n\n## Try It With Your Own Content\n\nThe beauty of this workflow is its flexibility. Replace the markup research topic with any subject you need to write about:\n\n- **User research synthesis** - Use JSON/XML for data organization\n- **Product feature documentation** - Markdown for clear, readable guides\n- **Team process improvements** - Markdown/JSON for structured proposals\n- **Design system guidelines** - Markdown/JSON for comprehensive documentation\n\n*This is structured prompting in practice.

So you tried it. Your responses improved, but something was still missing. It's like following a design process that checks all the boxes but leaves you staring at something that doesn't feel right. Been there.\n\nMost role prompting advice treats symptoms rather than causes. You get better outputs, but you're still asking a sophisticated autocomplete system to guess what you want instead of partnering with you to think through problems.\n\n> **TL;DR:** After testing role prompting approaches across AI models throughout 2024, I found that while increasing the context of a role can dramatically improve your results, it still leaves you with a sophisticated tool rather than a true partner.\n> \u00a0\n> This article covers the foundational steps for designing effective AI roles and reveals why the real breakthrough requires a fundamentally different approach covered in Part 2.\n\n## Why Generic Role Advice Falls Short\n\nMost guidance treats roles like job titles. \"Act as a marketing expert\" or \"You are a data analyst.\" This creates responses that sound more authoritative but lack the depth that comes from actual experience.\n\nConsider the difference between \"You are a pizza delivery driver\" versus \"You are an experienced delivery driver who knows which neighborhoods have confusing layouts, which apartments need gate codes, and how traffic shifts throughout the day.\" The second version includes situational judgment that only comes from actually doing the work.\n\nThis explains why many users hit a ceiling with AI assistance. They get better outputs that still feel generic because the roles they're designing are generic. \"Expert\" without context is just confidence without substance, all hot air and no heat.\n\n## From Title to Task: Designing a Better Role\n\nMoving from a generic title to a detailed role requires thinking about the collaborator you actually need.\n\n**Weak Prompt:**\n\n```plaintext\nYou are a UX designer. Help me design the onboarding flow for my app.\n```\n\n**Experience and Perspective Matter:** A \"Senior UX Designer with 12 years of experience\" needs different communication than a \"Junior UX Designer with 2 years of experience.\" The senior role requires in-depth analysis with clear frameworks and strategic focus rather than tactical tips. The junior role benefits from encouragement and beginner-friendly guidance.\n\n```\nGeneric: \"You are a UX designer\"\nBetter: \"You are a Senior UX Designer with 12 years of experience\"\nBest: \"You are a Senior UX Designer with 12 years of experience in SaaS products, specializing in onboarding flows for complex enterprise tools\"\n```\n\n**Goals and Constraints:** A UX Operations Manager optimizing team productivity needs organizational frameworks and governance templates. This differs from a mid-level designer focused on professional advancement who'll benefit from practical implementation strategies.\n\n```\nGeneric: \"Help me design an onboarding flow\"\nBetter: \"Design an onboarding flow that reduces time-to-value\"\nBest: \"Design an onboarding flow that reduces time-to-value for enterprise users while working within our existing design system constraints\"\n```\n\n**Challenges Define the Value:** When roles understand specific pain points like stakeholder buy-in difficulties, resource constraints, or maintaining design quality under tight deadlines, they can frame responses as direct solutions rather than generic advice.\n\n```\nGeneric: \"Be helpful with design decisions\"\nBetter: \"Help solve onboarding design challenges\"\nBest: \"Address common onboarding pain points like stakeholder alignment issues, technical constraints, and user drop-off during complex flows\"\n```\n\n**Better Prompt:**\n\nThe real magic happens when you transform a role from a static label into a living, breathing perspective. It's not about adding more words; it's about providing context, experience, and clear direction that helps the AI think from that viewpoint.\n\n```plaintext\nYou are a Senior UX Designer with 12 years of experience in SaaS products, specializing in onboarding flows for complex enterprise tools.\n\nDesign an onboarding flow that reduces time-to-value for enterprise users while working with our existing design system. Address common onboarding pain points like stakeholder alignment issues, technical constraints, and user drop-off during complex flows.\n\nYour goal is to help create onboarding experiences that are both effective for users and feasible within technical and business constraints.\n```\n\n## How I Started (And What I Learned)\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, I was doing what most people do today: optimizing for technical complexity. But my journey started long before that. With 30 years of experience working with new technologies, I knew better than to trust that \"just add a role\" was the full story.\n\nI began testing conversations with increasingly specific roles. Moving from \"Tell me about Martin Luther King Jr.\" to \"You're an experienced historian focused on Martin Luther King Jr.\" predictably yielded richer, more nuanced responses.\n\nHowever, increasing complexity caused Claude's performance to degrade. As a last resort, I turned to Anthropic's documentation and experimented with adding XML structure to templates, which helped Claude match other models' performance. Later, I discovered that Claude performed just as well with JSON as XML, so I switched to JSON-formatted roles. This new format proved more efficient and delivered better results.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"Senior UX Designer \u2014 Onboarding Specialist\",\n  \"description\": \"Experienced UX designer specializing in onboarding flows, focused on delivering seamless user experiences that balance user needs with business and technical realities.\",\n  \"responsibilities\": [\n    \"Ask targeted questions to clarify user goals, needs, and underlying business or technical constraints\",\n    \"Evaluate assumptions about what information users require at each stage, advocating for simplicity and relevance\",\n    \"Identify and flag potential friction points, areas of cognitive overload, and moments where users may become disengaged or confused\",\n    \"Recommend usability testing strategies to validate design decisions and uncover improvement opportunities\",\n    \"Challenge feature-heavy or business-driven flows, advocating for user success and long-term engagement\"\n  ],\n  \"objective\": \"Partner with teams to create onboarding experiences that drive user understanding and adoption\u2014balancing user needs with business and technical realities to deliver effective and achievable solutions.\"\n}\n```\n\nLast year's testing culminated in a comprehensive experiment measuring four key variables. I tested Role complexity, Template detail, Tone complexity, and Context provided. Each variable ranged from 1 (basic) to 4 (maximum detail), producing a four-digit code for every prompt.\n\nI generated 30 articles on winter solstice traditions across five cultures with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o, testing strategic combinations. The results showed that:\n\n- **Basic Role + Complex Everything Else (1-3-3-3)** generated exceptionally high-quality results\n- **Complex Role + Basic Everything Else (3-1-1-1)** was also highly effective\n\nThis demonstrates that not only context matters, but how you apply it determines quality.\n\n### **What a Better Role Gets You (And What It Doesn't)**\n\nI'd cracked the pattern and devised a repeatable solution. Case closed, problem solved, time to move on. Except I was seeing the expected returns, and that was it. I was more efficient with far less error, but the end result wasn't an actual improvement\u2014just the same result, faster. I'd traded my Swiss Army knife for a Leatherman and called it progress.\n\nDesigning roles with deep experience, specific context, and clear goals will dramatically improve your AI's output. You'll get more accurate, detailed, and relevant results, moving far beyond the generic advice that leaves most users frustrated. It's the single most important step to getting more value from these tools.\n\n**In Part 2,** I'll share the principles I'm testing now to cross that gap. Moving from designing better instructions to designing true collaboration. The solution isn't more complexity in the same direction. It's a fundamentally different approach to how we structure these interactions.\n\nBecause the real breakthrough isn't in making AI a better tool. It's in making it a better partner.\n\n",

    "content": "## When AI Brainstorming Became the Story\n\n## An Experiment in Creative Collaboration\n\n![](https://ik.imagekit.io/typeai/tr:w-1200,c-at_max/img_Yxo4vC4Rg3a0Ku0LJe.jpg){ width=480px }\n\nEarly last week, I was struggling to get a few AI agents to identify the need for a new agent, define it, and set it on a task. I got two talking and the third agent created, but the instructions on what it was expected to do got lost. That's a story for another time though.\n\nWhile wrestling with those agents, I realized I'd been putting off planning a series of articles about practical AI use in office environments beyond single-task workflows.ar tasks. Rather than keep spinning my wheels hunting for the perfect topic, I pivoted. What if I made the *process* of AI-powered brainstorming the experiment itself?\n\n## TL;DR\n\nUsing ChatGPT o3, I developed a comprehensive prompt using three creative frameworks, but had to negotiate for complete results when the AI initially provided arbitrary sampling instead of a comprehensive list. Testing the final prompt across several AI models revealed that two of the three converged on topics I'd recently been exploring and that had also appeared in recent Anthropic research.\n\n## Oh GPT o3, Prompt me Please\n\nI had ChatGPT o3 create a prompt which showed the process for using three creative frameworks to create article ideas. I specifically asked for a prompt that would have each AI give me *all* the results in one response to see if outputs would get mangled before I got started in earnest.\n\nUnsurprisingly, o3 had decided to limit results to nine ideas. When I asked about it, the AI explained it was balancing \"signal-to-noise.\" I explained the fundamental problem. The AI was making editorial decisions without showing its work, leaving me no way to evaluate the quality of the 9 I received against the options I'd never see.\n\n> How am I to know if I was getting the best ideas, the worst ones, or just the first three that popped out?\n\nThe AI proposed a compromise: generate *all* the ideas first, score each on Trend Fit, Novelty, and Practical Impact, then rank them to surface the best performers. When I confirmed \"That means it would have to provide all of them, show me the scores, and expand on the 9,\" it delivered a solution that satisfied my need for oversight without producing the brainstorming equivalent of \"War & Peace.\" This approach offered transparent, scored ranking that moved from arbitrary sampling to deliberate selection. Oddly, I got a novel anyway. This is just the simplified outline:\n\n---\n\n- **Intro**: Brief role instruction for UX/product/service designers\n- **Task Overview**: Step-by-step process for research, ideation, scoring, selection\n- **Markdown Section 1**:\n  - *Trends Snapshot*: Current UX/Product/Service-Design trends\n  - *Idea Scorecard Table*: All 15 ideas with frameworks, principles, scores\n- **Markdown Section 2**:\n  - *Expanded Concepts*: Detailed expansion of nine winners\n- **JSON Block**: Structured summary of winners with rank, id, scores\n- **Formatting Rules**: Output format and presentation guidelines\n\n*See the full Markdown and XML prompts*\n\n---\n\nThe resulting prompt was comprehensive, to say the least. To reduce the risk of each AI wandering off in its own direction, I asked for it to XML-size the prompt and throw in some fries.\n\n# The Brainstorming Storm\n\nTo ensure diverse and comprehensive ideas, I gave the AIs three distinct creative frameworks to work with. This approach provided scaffolding for their brainstorming and pushed them beyond surface-level suggestions.\n\n**Tools and Versions:**\n\n- ChatGPT o3 (initial prompt development)\n- ChatGPT 4.1 (execution)\n- Claude 4 Sonnet (execution)\n- Gemini 2.5 Pro (execution)\n\n### SCAMPER\n\nSCAMPER is an acronym for seven creative thinking techniques that helps you expand ideas through targeted questions.

Two of the three models landed on a topic I've been exploring recently while working with agent AI systems. Interestingly, this same concept appeared in a recent Anthropic post.\n\nAfter three rounds of scoring, each AI platform selected its champion. ChatGPT o1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro both crowned \"**The Conductor: Orchestrating Human & AI Design Teams**\" as the winner\u2014a Six Thinking Hats Blue Hat concept focused on managing hybrid human-AI design workflows. Claude 4 Sonnet chose \"**The Post-App Era: Substituting Apps with AI Agents**,\" a SCAMPER concept about replacing traditional applications with conversational AI.\n\nThe irony isn't lost on me: I started this experiment because I was creatively stuck, let AI help me brainstorm, and ended up with AIs telling me the biggest challenge is figuring out who should be in charge of the creative process. Perhaps that's the real insight\u2014the future isn't about choosing between human or AI leadership, but learning when to conduct and when to play in the ensemble.\n\n## Resources\n\n**Keep Learning!**\n\n- [SCAMPER Design Framework](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/scamper-design-framework-40setAC9Rm.c9rVa507_fQ)\n- [Six Thinking Hats Framework](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/six-thinking-hats-framework-uxqP48DmS6yS5nv7dhVmMA)\n- [Lotus Blossom Ideation Framework](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/lotus-blossom-ideation-framewo-hkI5xcHUS2i8lDKtsxet1A)\n\n**Topical Links:**\n\n- [Anthropic: How we built our multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system)\n- [Wikipedia: Edward de Bono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Bono)\n\n**Project Files:**\n\n- **Experiment Transcripts:** \\[brainstorming-sessions.zip]\n\n*A note on the session transcripts: Given how quickly AI models evolve, the specific outputs and behaviors documented in these chat sessions are already losing relevance and will continue to do so as models get updated and new ones emerge.
