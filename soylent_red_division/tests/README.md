## 📚 Test Writing Guidelines

### Writing New Tests

**Test Structure:**
```python
def test_descriptive_test_name(self, fixtures):
    """Test description explaining what is being tested"""
    # Arrange - Set up test data and conditions
    # Act - Execute the operation being tested
    # Assert - Verify the expected outcomes
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use appropriate fixtures for test data
- Mock external dependencies (LLMs, file systems)
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Verify both functional and non-functional requirements

**Test Categories:**
- Mark tests with appropriate pytest markers
- Group related tests in test classes
- Use parametrized tests for multiple scenarios
- Keep tests focused and independent

### Mock Usage Guidelines

**LLM Mocking:**
```python
@patch('src.soylent_red_division.crew.SoylentRedDivision._get_brand_context')
def test_with_mocked_llm(self, mock_brand_context):
    mock_brand_context.return_value = "Mock brand context"
    # Test implementation
```

**File System Mocking:**
- Use `temp_project_root` fixture for file operations
- Create isolated test environments
- Clean up test artifacts automatically

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Common Test Issues

**Test Isolation:**
- Ensure tests don't depend on each other
- Use fresh fixtures for each test
- Clean up shared resources properly

**Mock Configuration:**
- Verify mock setup matches actual interfaces
- Check mock call counts and arguments
- Reset mocks between tests

**Timing Issues:**
- Use appropriate timeouts for async operations
- Mock time-dependent operations when possible
- Account for system performance variations

### Debugging Tools

```bash
# Verbose output with full tracebacks
pytest -v -s --tb=long

# Stop on first failure
pytest -x

# Interactive debugging
pytest --pdb

# Show local variables in failures
pytest --showlocals
```
